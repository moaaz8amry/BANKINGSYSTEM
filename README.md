An object-oriented C++ project has been developed to simulate banking operations. The system incorporates classes for managing customers, accounts, and transactions, alongside classes for providing banking services. Core functionalities include the creation and maintenance of these entities, as well as the execution of banking transactions like withdrawals, deposits, and transfers. Customers can also access and review their account details, encompassing balances and transaction history.
